# Project Title

1033 & 2020



## Description

We are looking to foremost compare conflict and protest data this year in the US
with police data over the last two decades. Through the Department of Defense's
Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO), local and state law enforcement agencies
can request surplus military equipment through LESO’s 1033 Program. This
equipment can range anywhere from popcorn machines to parkas, and from
grenade launchers to mine-resistant armored transportation. Use of this equipment
has been cited as a leading indicator, and perhaps cause, of an increasingly
militaristic mindset amongst America's law enforcement agencies. This “warriors”
mindset was on full display during the Summer of 2020 when overwhelmingly
peaceful protests in response to the murder of George Floyd were met with often
violent responses from the nation’s myriad law enforcement agencies. Our group’s
project seeks to determine whether or not a correlation exists between the use of
1033 equipment in a given county and an increase in the use of force against
protesters in the same county. Users can search for the correlation between these
two factors, as well as demographic information for every county, such as racial
makeup, income, unemployment, and education, for every county in the United
States.
